Configure a private network to have a set of accounts, each with a coin-balance
Use a “minting” smart contract to establish distribute an initial coin balance to all accounts
Create a smart contract which “randomly” selects two accounts and performs a transaction of coins between them.
Create a javascript program which uses web3.js to perform an automated deployment of this smart contract at an adjustable rate.
Create a javascript program to assess the “busyness” of the network (using server stats or OS-level evaluations)
